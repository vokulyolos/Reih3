Chases down low health enemies with increased speed.
The Flayed Twins' obscene demand for blood could only be met through constant carnage, a task for which Strygwyr was more than suited. Driven by insatiable Thirst, the Bloodseeker senses blood of the mortally wounded from leagues away, and chases them down with eager speed. Through sacred markings on his gear, the blood of the freshly sacrificed flows directly to the Flayed Ones, leaving just enough to mend his wounds and fuel his imbued Rage. Strygwyr paints the land with a crimson ring, silencing foes caught in this Blood Ritual. Forcing difficult decisions on his enemies, for those who run only hasten their own demise. The Bloodseeker Ruptures every artery, causing his victim to hemorrhage with each step. To satisfy the demands of the Flayed Twins, Bloodseeker even goes as far to sacrifice some of his, spraying his own blood around him in a Bloody Mist. By blood loss or by Strygwyr's tribal blades, death is but a foregone conclusion.
