Surprises enemies with invisible landmines and explosive attacks.
Techies Demolitions was not so much a business as it was an excuse for Squee, Spleen, and Spoon to practice their favorite hobby: Blowin' stuff up. For them, battle is a matter of mischief. Giggling while they place misleading Minefield Signs, lob Sticky Bombs around the battlefield, hiding their renowned Proximity Mines they buried beneath Toterin that collapsed the town into a heap of rubble, testing their latest invention â€” a disarming zaps firing Reactive Tazer, and much more. Techies Demolitions handles dissatisfied customers with unexpected cheer. Their last words "Blast Off!" can be heard just before an epic and reckless explosion delivers enough to leave most enemies dead. Or at least enraged. Often both.
