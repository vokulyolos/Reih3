Powerful healer who can briefly prevent death.
A journey to the Nothl Realm changes all its visitors, not least of which Dazzle, a young acolyte of the Dezun Order. Consecrated as a Shadow Priest, Dazzle sends outs Shadow Waves to mend and maim. Foes are crippled by his paralytic enchantment â€” the Poison Touch, while allies are blessed with Shallow Graves, cheating death no matter how severe their injuries. As for himself, with each spell cast, each invocation of his strange Juju magic advances the efficiency of his spell-casting. Enemies within earshot of his incantations feel their bodies weaken, for those who cross Dazzle are invariably afflicted with an eternity of Bad Juju.
